Our hero, a tiny little squirrel called Bjoern, wears the shiniest of all armor.

Bjoern also had a pet seagull that could fly high and keep a lookout for any danger.

Despite being an awesome warrior that protected the forest from all evil so had
he also some serious issues.. like all heroes. He patrolled the forest with a smile
as he took care of every nuisance that crossed his path.
But no one knew that he had to fight his inner demons every night.. the drooling squirel screamed out his pain. 

The forest whispered to him.. as he looked down in the pond. 

He saw a weathered face that reminded him of all the years fighting and protecting those he loved
