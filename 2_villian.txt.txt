The evil villain enters, a tall vicious super-troll named Olafur!

Many animals were fooled by his appearance and manner...
it was quite funny how easy it was to get close to his prey by just pretending
to be nice..

The villain's pet was nothing like its master.
It spat and drooled as it jumped back and forth between the buildings
and devoured every animal. The ground trembled as it approached its next target.
